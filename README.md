**Description**
This game is a word based game. The theme of the game is an adventure game where the user's goal is to find Dora who has been kidnapped by swiper. The point of view for the game will be Doras companion, Boots the monkey. The whole game will be text based with no graphics and it will include various different paths for the user to follow. The user will venture through two different maps: a house and a basement. Boots will need to find Doras tools that were left behind in order to track her down. There will be various booby traps set in place to stop the user without it being too complex to figure out. The game ends with two different outcomes either finding dora and winning or finding swiper and losing.
